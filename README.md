## If I'll find any other feature to be useful - it'll surely be added!
## What is it?
Container orchestration platform that automates their managing. It provides many benefits - allows for high availability services, auto-scaling containers, eases managing high quantities of containers and many more.
## Different options
Apart of standard k8s there is several other choices:
* **Minikube** - a tool for running a local, single-node Kubernetes cluster on a single machine, good for local learing, experiments, development and testing
* **k3s** - a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed to run on edge computing and in resource-constrained environment, removes some components to reduce resource consumption
* **k3d** - a tool for running k3s clusters in Docker containers, it allows you to quickly create and destroy Kubernetes clusters on your local machine
* **k0s** - a minimal Kubernetes distribution that is easy to install and manage, runs both small and large clusters
* **MicroK8s** - lightweight Kubernetes distribution, designed for small-scale development, testing, and deployment, runs on a single node and is easy to configure
* **Kind** - a tool for running Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers, mainly for testing and development
* **EKS, AKS, GKE** - a managed Kubernetes service from cloud providers \(in order - Amazon, Azure, Google\)
